Professional Bootstrap Portfolio

Files created:
- index.html — main portfolio page (Bootstrap 5, Font Awesome)
- css/style.css — custom styles
- js/script.js — small interactions (smooth scroll, demo contact handler)

How to view locally:
1. If using XAMPP, move the `portfolio` folder under `htdocs` (already placed).
2. Start Apache and open in a browser:

   http://localhost/pratice_work/portfolio/

Customize:
- Replace text and images in `index.html`.
- Update colors in `css/style.css`.
- Hook the contact form to your backend or an email service.

Notes:
- This is a static starter using CDN assets. For production, consider bundling and optimizing assets.
